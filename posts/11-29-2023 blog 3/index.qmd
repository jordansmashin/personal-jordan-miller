## Introduction

In the dynamic landscape of the cryptocurrency market, FTX emerged as a prominent player, quickly rising to prominence and captivating the attention of investors and traders alike. This essay explores the trajectory of FTX, from its inception and ascendancy to its eventual downfall, while employing the philosophical lens of John Stuart Mill's utilitarianism to analyze the decision-making processes that may have contributed to its demise.

## Background Info

FTX was founded in 2017 by Sam Bankman-Fried and Gary Wang, with a vision to create a cutting-edge cryptocurrency exchange platform that offered a wide range of trading products and derivatives. The company's commitment to innovation and user-centric design quickly distinguished it from its competitors. FTX leveraged its technological prowess to introduce unique offerings like tokenized stocks, prediction markets, and innovative trading tools, garnering attention and investment from the crypto community. FTX's success was rooted in its utilitarian approach to product development. The platform aimed to maximize happiness and satisfaction for its users by providing a seamless and comprehensive trading experience. Mill's utilitarianism states that the moral worth of an action is determined by its overall utility, or its ability to produce the greatest happiness for the greatest number. FTX's introduction of novel financial instruments and features aligned with utilitarian principles as it aimed to expand the opportunities for profit and financial growth for its users. The utilitarian perspective would argue that FTX's success during this period was ethically sound, as it contributed to the happiness and economic well-being of a significant number of individuals participating in the cryptocurrency market. As FTX continued to innovate, it faced decisions that would impact both its users and the broader crypto ecosystem. Applying Mill's utilitarianism to these decisions reveals the complex interplay between the pursuit of profit and the welfare of the users. One of FTX's innovative moves was the introduction of leveraged tokens, allowing users to amplify their gains (or losses) with leverage. From a utilitarian perspective, this decision could be justified if it increased overall happiness by providing users with more opportunities for profit. However, it also introduced higher risks, potentially leading to substantial losses for less experienced traders. Critics argue that FTX's utilitarian calculus may have been skewed toward short-term gains, neglecting the long-term well-being of users. Mill's philosophy emphasizes the importance of considering the quality, not just the quantity, of happiness. FTX's focus on immediate profitability through leveraged products may have overlooked the potential harm caused to individuals facing significant financial losses.

## The expansion

As FTX expanded, concerns about market manipulation arose. The platform's introduction of prediction markets allowed users to bet on a wide range of events, from political outcomes to stock prices. While these markets added a layer of excitement, they also raised ethical questions about the consequences of incentivizing speculation and potentially manipulative behavior. Utilitarian analysis here would involve weighing the happiness derived from engaging users in novel and exciting trading activities against the potential harm caused by market manipulation. Mill's utilitarianism would caution against actions that could lead to a skewed distribution of happiness, especially if a small number of users were benefiting at the expense of the broader market. FTX's ascent was met with challenges, and its ultimate decline can be attributed to a combination of regulatory scrutiny, ethical concerns, and the consequences of its own ambitious strategies. As cryptocurrency markets attracted increased regulatory attention, FTX found itself navigating complex legal landscapes. The utilitarian perspective on regulatory compliance suggests that adhering to laws and regulations is essential for the greater good, ensuring market stability and protecting users from potential harm. FTX's challenges with regulators might be viewed through a utilitarian lens as a consequence of its prioritization of innovation over regulatory compliance. The platform's failure to address regulatory concerns may have negatively impacted the overall happiness and confidence of its user base, as legal uncertainties create an environment of risk and instability. The utilitarian evaluation of FTX's downfall also considers the ethical implications of its actions on its users. The leverage and risk associated with some of its products resulted in substantial financial losses for many traders. From a utilitarian standpoint, the harm caused to individuals who suffered significant losses could be seen as outweighing the short-term benefits enjoyed by those who profited. Additionally, the market manipulation concerns raised questions about the ethical responsibility of FTX in fostering an environment conducive to fair and transparent trading. The utilitarian calculus would emphasize the importance of ensuring that the majority of users derive happiness from trading activities without being adversely affected by a minority engaging in manipulative practices.

## Conclusion

FTX's journey, from a pioneering force in the cryptocurrency space to a company grappling with regulatory challenges and ethical concerns, offers a nuanced case study. Utilizing John Stuart Mill's utilitarianism philosophy provides a framework to analyze the decisions made by FTX throughout its trajectory. While FTX initially succeeded in maximizing happiness by offering innovative products and opportunities for profit, its downfall underscores the importance of considering long-term consequences and ethical implications. Mill's utilitarianism encourages a holistic evaluation of actions, emphasizing the need to balance short-term gains with the well-being of the broader community. In the case of FTX, the utilitarian analysis suggests that a more cautious approach to product development, a greater emphasis on regulatory compliance, and a proactive stance against market manipulation could have contributed to a more sustainable and ethically sound trajectory. The rise and fall of FTX serve as a cautionary tale for companies operating in rapidly evolving industries, urging them to prioritize the greater good and ethical considerations in their pursuit of success.
